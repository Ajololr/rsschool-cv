### Summary

My goal is to get a profound knowledge in the field of programming, especially in front-end development. At the moment I study at university and wish to graduate with honors. New challenges do not deter me, as I'm always ready to learn something new. I found self education one the most important ways to achieve high results in any scope, as well as meeting new people, because there will be something to share with others. 

### Skills

#### Programming languages:
1. Delphi
2. Assembler
3. C
4. HTML/CSS/JS (basics)
